            <strong>üìçSituation:</strong> Industrial 3D printing is
            revolutionizing manufacturing, yet most small and mid-sized
            businesses lack the capital and infrastructure to adopt this
            technology. Recognizing this gap, our team proposed a B2B
            leasing-as-a-service model for 3D printers that could reduce upfront
            costs and offer a scalable, maintenance-friendly deployment.

                <li>
                  Created an inventory control dashboard using Power BI, helping
                  store managers visualize SKU status (stockouts, overstock,
                  reorder) and trends across product lines (e.g., formalwear,
                  casualwear, seasonal).
                </li>
                <li>
                  Designed a simple weekly reporting system that alerted the
                  procurement team on low-stock items and flagged forecast
                  deviations over 10%.
                </li>

          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1">
            <li>
              Reduced stockouts by 20%, especially for high-frequency fashion
              SKUs, improving customer satisfaction and walk-in conversion
              rates.
            </li>
            <li>
              Achieved a 15% reduction in inventory carrying costs by trimming
              overstock and improving procurement precision.
            </li>
            <li>
              Improved supplier delivery reliability by aligning purchase
              frequency with predicted demand, reducing last-minute order rushes
              by 40%.
            </li>
            <li>
              Retailer adopted the solution as part of their monthly store
              planning cadence, with staff trained to maintain and update the
              models post-engagement.
