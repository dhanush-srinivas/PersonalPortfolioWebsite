            <strong>üìçSituation:</strong> Industrial 3D printing is
            revolutionizing manufacturing, yet most small and mid-sized
            businesses lack the capital and infrastructure to adopt this
            technology. Recognizing this gap, our team proposed a B2B
            leasing-as-a-service model for 3D printers that could reduce upfront
            costs and offer a scalable, maintenance-friendly deployment.

In this simulated environment, we were tasked with optimizing the planning pipeline for Global Bike Inc. by leveraging SAP Integrated Business Planning (IBP) and Advanced Planning &amp; Optimization (APO) modules.

            <strong>üéØ Task:</strong> The goal was to simulate and improve an end-to-end supply chain process covering demand forecasting, supply network planning, and material requirements planning (MRP) across multiple plants and distribution centers. KPIs included forecast accuracy, procurement lead time, and inventory availability.
